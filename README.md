# Hands-On (Hacky Hour @ DPG spring meeting 2019, Rostock)



## Installation

You can either complete this tutorial online using only [GitHub](https://github.com) (you need to create a free account) or use a local repository.
For using a local repository, you need a local git installation.
* Installation instructions either [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), a simple GUI for Mac/Windows with everything included.

## Let's do this

Depending whether you use GitHub only online or a local installation, go to different websites:
* If you are only using GitHub online, follow [this Git Hello World! example](https://guides.github.com/ activities/hello-world/).
* If you are using git locally:

## Overview of common commands / actions

```

## A basic workflow

## Branching and merging

1. Create a branch
2. Make changes inside the branch
3. Stage and commit these changes
4. Push branch to remote
5. See changes on remote
6. Switch to master branch
7. Also make some changes here to the same file
    * Avoid merge conflicts by only changing different lines
    * Or see what a merge conflict can look like: Change the same content as in 2. but do different changes
8. Merge the new branch and the master
9.  Push local master branch
10. Look at the local (or remote) commit history
