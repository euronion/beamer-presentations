# Hands-On (Hacky Hour @ DPG spring meeting 2019, Rostock)



## Installation

### Online only
You can either complete this tutorial online using only [GitHub](https://github.com), in which case you need a to have a (free) account.

* [Create an account here](https://github.com/join)

### Alternative
Or you can use a local repository (with or without a linked GitHub account).
In this case you need a local installation, instructions are as follows:
* (Recommended for Windows/MacOS) For `git` + a slim and essential GUI: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
* (Other OS/Else) See instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Let's do this

Depending whether you use GitHub only online or a local installation, go to different websites:
* If you are using GitHub online, follow [this Git Hello World! example](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
* If you are using git locally, follow steps 1. to 5. of [this guide](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).
    > Note for users of GitHub Desktop:  
    > No dedicated examples for you today, but you can follow the link
    > above in the GUI as well.  
    > The command names given are identical to the buttons you are looking for in the GUI.  
    > I have faith in you, you will figure it out! :)
